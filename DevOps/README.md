## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a technology model that enables on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, such as servers, storage, networking, and services, over the internet.  

Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware, users can leverage scalable and flexible resources provided by cloud service providers.   

This approach allows for cost-effective, on-the-fly provisioning of resources, and it supports various applications, services, and workloads without the need for significant upfront investments in infrastructure.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It includes virtual machines, storage, and networking

Users can rent virtualized hardware and infrastructure, allowing them to deploy and run their own software, applications, and operating systems.

Examples: 
* Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
* Google Compute Engine
* IBM Cloud Virtual Servers
* DigitalOcean
* Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
* Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
* Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
* Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
* Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
* Amazon ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
* Amazon Route 53 (Domain Name System)
* Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL Database)
* Amazon Glacier (Low-cost Storage)
* Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS provides a higher-level platform that includes not only the infrastructure but also development tools, middleware, and services to help developers build, deploy, and manage applications.

Developers can focus on coding and application development without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. PaaS abstracts away complexities, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications. 

Examples:
* Heroku
* Google App Engine
* Microsoft Azure App Service
* Red Hat OpenShift
* IBM Cloud Foundry
* SAP Cloud Platform
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* AWS Lambda
* AWS App Runner
* AWS CodePipeline
* AWS CodeBuild
* AWS CodeDeploy
* AWS Step Functions
* Amazon API Gateway
* AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
* AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS delivers fully developed and ready-to-use software applications over the internet.

Users can access and use software applications through a web browser without the need for installation or maintenance. SaaS providers handle software updates, security, and infrastructure management. 

Examples: 
* Google Workspace
* Microsoft Office 365
* Salesforce
* Dropbox
* Slack
* Zoom
