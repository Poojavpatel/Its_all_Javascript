## Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

Its primary role in online security is that it enables you to access multiple web applications using one set of login credentials

SAML works by passing information about users, logins, and attributes between the identity provider and service providers. Each user logs in once to Single Sign On with the identify provider, and then the identify provider can pass SAML attributes to the service provider when the user attempts to access those services

## What is difference between SAML and SSO?

SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Mark-up Language) is an umbrella standard that covers federation, identity management and single sign-on (SSO).

## SSO (Single sign-on)

Single sign-on is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems. True single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors
