# Golang

### Golang Is Fast
Golang is a compiled language, which means the code written is directly translated into formats that a processor understands. Meanwhile, the program in Java is compiled into bytecode that are executed by the virtual machine.

### Golang Is Well-Scaled
* The Go language has Goroutines, which are basically functions that can run simultaneously and independently.
* Goroutines take up only 2 kB of memory, which makes it scalable when the need for running multiple concurrent processes arise. 
* Unlike Java threads, which are blocking by nature, Goroutines are non-blocking. Goroutines is the combination of async approach used by JavaScript and the traditional multi-threading used by Java. 
* Technically, you can run millions of GoRoutines without crashing the system. Having a leaner and meaner software gives you an edge over your competitors.
