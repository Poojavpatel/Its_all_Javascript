### Azure vs AWS
* One of the main differences between Azure and AWS is the scope of services they offer. Azure has a more extensive range of services that cover a wide range of scenarios, including artificial intelligence, internet of things, and blockchain, while AWS services are more focused on infrastructure, storage, and databases.
* Azure integrates well with other Microsoft services, such as Windows Server and Office 365
* Pricing - Azure is generally considered to be more cost-effective for smaller workloads, while AWS is better suited for larger workloads
