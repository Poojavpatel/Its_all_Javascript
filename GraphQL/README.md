### About GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs. It allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of information compared to traditional REST APIs.

GraphQL provides a more flexible and efficient way for clients to interact with APIs by enabling them to define the structure of the response according to their specific requirements.
