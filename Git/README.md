## Choose current or incoming when merging branches 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16825849/choose-git-merge-strategy-for-specific-files-ours-mine-theirs

**Git Rebase**
theirs is actually the current branch in the case of rebase.     
So the below set of commands are actually accepting your current branch changes over the remote branch.

```bash
# accept your current branch changes over the remote branch
# ours: branch-a, theirs: branch-b
git rebase -X theirs branch-b
```

**Git Merge**
For merge, the meaning of theirs and ours is reversed. So, to get the same effect during a merge,    
i.e., keep your current branch changes (ours) over the remote branch being merged (theirs).

```bash
# assuming branch-a is our current version
# ours: branch-a, theirs: branch-b
$ git merge -X ours branch-b  
```
